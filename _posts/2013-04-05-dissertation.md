# Abstract

This dissertation looks at the design issues surrounding ubiquitous computing. 

- The nature of the post-PC era and the manifestation of the ubiquitous, pervasive, tangible computing that lies in its wake.
- Ubiquitous computing and its origin - why and how was it envisioned?
- Torch was carried by Greenfield in his coining of the phrase everyware and outlining of the requirements for, benefits and dangers of intelligence, computation everywhere.
- With computation firmly embedded into the fabric of our world, it too becomes the interface. I’m exploring what this means for interaction, product and system designers from the perspective of affordance, emotion and technomethodology.
- New graphic languages and lexicons will need to be devised in order communicate the presence, function and 
- Culminating with an outline of how, through utilising open source software and hardware, the realisation and fate of ubiquitous computing lies firmly in the hands of artists and hackers.

Despite the drastic improvements in the speed, power and cost of computational devices over the last century, their form and the manner in which we interact with them have changed very little. The recent mobile revolution saw the “age of beige boxes” (Dourish, Page 27, Where the Action Is) give way to an “obsession with glowing rectangles” (The Onion), such transitions are hardly akin to metamorphoses. Everyware brings with it not only a drastic change in the appearance of computing, but also a completely different mode of interaction; one that, together with the hardware, embeds and embodies itself in the physical world.

This arrival at what has become known as ‘tangible’ computing was not abrupt. Incremental developments in human-computer interaction, since the computers own conception, have led us here. Paul Dourish gives an insightful rundown of this evolution – telling us where the action was – in his book titled “Where the Action Is”. He traces it right back to the electrical configuration of early computational hardware and basic symbolic instruction using punchcards, through to textual input via the green glare of the command line and the familiar metaphorical, two-dimensional realm of the graphical user interface. He notes that despite the disjointed, apparently sporadic advancement of interaction methods and models; with each step comes a “gradual incorporation of a wider range of human skills and abilities” (Dourish, Page 14, Where the Action Is). The end goal of which is to realise a form of computational interaction that is intuitive, uncomplicated and “integrated into our daily lives”. Abstraction became integration. Fundamentally, the computer has been adapted and changed to suit the users wants and needs, inline with our predefined, psychologically and physiologically determined skills and abilities.

To do so, manifestations of tangible computing will need to cater to, exploit and potentially enhance our humanness – to employ learnings regarding how we perceive, interact with, and interact in the world. Dourish states that “we act in the world by exploring its physical affordances” (Dourish, Page 18, Where the Action Is) – the term ‘affordance’ has its roots in psychology and was defined by Gibson: “The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (Gibson, Page 127, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception).current design

The proliferation of everyware will see everything we do; the microinteractions we engage in and that make up our day-to-day lives, being transacted, mediated or augmented by technology. But the ubiquitousness of the smart phone, wireless network connectivity and World Wide Web mean that a great deal of our lives is already conducted in the digital realm. Conducted through interactions that are still heavily dominated by the graphical representations of visual metaphors, abstractions and _.

Because of its unfamiliar nature, much of the interaction with graphical user interfaces and the web has to be learned and remembered. There is nothing particularly intuitive about using the web.

But the numerous processes that are already facilitated by the Internet – or more rightly the World Wide Web – things like booking train tickets, checking your bank balance or, in some countries, paying your taxes aren’t necessarily the frictionless, futuristic experiences of the techno-utopia we dreamt of.

The foundational technologies of the web make it the perfect platform for test-driven, user-centric, iterative design. Yet the quality of user experience on the web certainly leaves something to be desired.

Through the invention of the Internet – or more rightly the World Wide Web – previously analog processes have now become digital. We purchase goods, work remotely and even do a large portion of our communication through tools, applications and websites powered by the Internet. But no one can say that these are the frictionless, futuristic experiences of the techno-utopia we dreamt of and were promised. Designers of these systems still have a lot to learn, lessons that it would appear are necessary to learn over again with each new medium.

Despite the proven superiority of test-driven, iterative, human-centred design the web can still be a scary, confusing, and frustrating place at times. Even for the most technologically savvy individuals. This is perhaps symptomatic of the industry’s focus on the chrome around the content. Skewed priorities mean the practice is heavily weighted towards stylistically pleasant interfaces, with less importance placed on the newly rediscovered disciplines of information architecture and user experience. This bias is more often becoming a matter of budget, perhaps even laziness, rather than ignorance. These things take time (and thus money).

During this silent, but persistent revolution, we will need  calm, usable technology that conveniently recedes from the forefront of our lives.

The time (and thus money) required to make websites usable for users not themselves further hindered by a disability, giving rise to issues of accessibility, . Technology often trumps usability and as developers are beguiled by the shiny new toys that the Today’s browser vendors .

The term ‘affordance’ has its roots in psychology and was defined by Gibson: “The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (Gibson, Page 127, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception).**Word count: 1063**
